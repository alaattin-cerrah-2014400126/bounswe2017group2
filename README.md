# Looking For Concerts
## The meeting point of musical concert goers!

Looking for Concerts is a platform for musical concert-goers, where people from all ages come together to experience the warmth of a live concert stage with thousands of other music lovers. After a user signs up, he can create concerts, follow or be followed by friends, search for concerts, see his friends' activity and attend concerts! Our intelligent recommendation engine will quickly pick up his interests. Especially if he connects his LFC account with Spotify. What's more, he can find past concerts and get lost in the comments, upvoting, downvoting and reacting! We would like to provide an immersive experience and help concert-goers find both exciting concerts to go to and interesting people to go to those concerts with.

Looking For Concerts both has a [Web](http://34.210.127.92:8000/home) and Android version. The Android version is not release on the Google Play Store yet but stay tuned!
